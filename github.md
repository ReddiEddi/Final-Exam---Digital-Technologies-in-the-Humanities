## GitHub

If you are reading this, you have hopefully accessed this website via GitHub. If you didn’t, here is a brief explanation of what Github is. If not, then it is impressive that you managed to find this.

A simple definition of GitHub is that it ‘is a platform that hosts code, providing version control and collaboration features. It enables you and others to work together on projects from anywhere in the world’ (Opoku, 2024). It is a repository for different pieces of free and open-source software (FOSS) where anyone can make a piece of code or software and upload it to their cloud-based servers. Users are encouraged to do this and even to edit each other’s codes via branching for improvement or bug fixes, after which the forks can be merged if needed (GitHub, 2022). When it comes to uploading a product to GitHub, one would create a repository (repo), upload files, and make it available to the public. It also had the advantage of single files being edited without having to complicate the process of removing old files to replace them with new ones. Instead, one will commit a change to a file, and then push the said change to the repo along with a changelog (Opoku, 2024). Since everyone has access to GitHub, many pieces of code or software have even been used in bigger projects.

A small piece of software, which can be highlighted as an example, is a browser extension called 10ten Japanese Reader (Free Software Foundation, 2025). Japan has three writing systems. Two of these have 46 different characters (called *hiragana* and *katakana*) each and can be used to write the entire Japanese language but out of context it is difficult to know what is meant due to the frequency of homophones. The third writing system (called *kanji*) solves this challenge, but there are officially 2,136 characters in common use (Hasegawa, 2014, pp. 43-57). The 10Ten software helps many learners with this reading aid as it can both display readings, different writings, verb and adjective conjugations, pitch accent and how common the word or phrase is. It also has the functionality to convert Japanese units of measurement, currency, and calendar. And it can do this by simply hovering over a given word in the website (Free Software Foundation, 2025). This was merely a small browser extension, but what has been shared on GitHub can be uses for much bigger projects. According to GitHub themselves, code on their platform has even been used in missions on Mars (GitHub, 2022).

This website has been uploaded to GitHub for other people to see, and for any creator to play around with it. Given the insignificance of this website with mere basic code, not many changes will happen, nor is to be expected. It is, however, good to know that the possibility exists. If you are reading this, this means that one or several commits to this website have been pushed. Hopefully, you have also been able to read all other sections which have been pushed as separate markdown files. If you haven’t, try pushing one of the buttons to the left.
