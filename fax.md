## Japan’s Technology: A Paradox

Japan seems to have a reputation to be a country with technology that surpasses many developed countries and surprises many people. There have also been many articles, videos, and memes claiming that Japan is living in 2050 by primarily showcasing Japanese technologies including toilets with bidet functions and heated seats, advanced vending machines, and advanced smart homes (Japambience, 2024; Omololu, 2025; Rethinking the Future, 2024). What most media will not write about is that while there are many modern technologies in Japan, there are also some which will be seen as archaic and some vital processes, which have been digitised elsewhere in the world, have not been in Japan. This brief article will first introduce some revolutionary Japanese technologies from the past. Afterwards, it will explore the country’s use of the fax machine, a technology which has been phased out in most parts of the world, but which is still in use in Japan (Coopersmith & Kettl, 2015, pp. 199, 203-205).

### A brief example of revolutionising Japanese technologies

There was a time when Japan was technologically ahead in various fields. In the field of video games, Nintendo saved the video game industry after the video game crash in the first half of the 1980s (Wolf, 2012, pp. 4-5), after which Sony and SEGA entered the home console market with varying degrees of success (Koyama, 2023, p. 173). In the field of audio, Sony invented the portable transistor radio in 1955 (Sony, n.d.-c), and both portable cassette players and CD players in 1968 and 1984 respectively (Sony, n.d.-b). In home video, JVC developed and released VHS in 1976 (JVC, n.d.). In past years, however, there have not been many technologies developed in Japan that have revolutionised the world as the previous examples have. Sony is still developing video game consoles under the PlayStation brand (Sony Interactive Entertainment, 2025), and they were one of the developers of the Blu-Ray disc (Sony, n.d.-a), but the concept of both home video game consoles and disk-based visual media have existed for years. The transition from DVD to Blu-Ray (which both are the same physical size) is not as revolutionising as that from a bulky VHS to a flat DVD.

### Fax machines

With the rest of the world having digitised the way of sending written messages via e-mail in business settings, Japan still relies on the use of fax machines. Fax became much more successful in Japan than in Europe and the USA because of the Japanese written language. The first is that Europe and the USA had the teletype, which is a system where two automated typewrites can send and receive messages (Huurdeman, 2005, p. 302). A typewriter has physical limitations for how many letters they can have. For a language that uses any alphabet with a few dozen characters, the teletype is plenty, but Japan has more than 2,000 characters in common use (Hasegawa, 2014, p. 53). Developing a massive typewriter to manage 2000 characters would be too expensive and too complicated (Coopersmith & Kettl, 2015, p. 138). Japan immediately benefitted from the fax machine as it is an optical scanning device. One would write something by hand and send it through the fax machine, and a facsimile of the document would be sent to the receiving end (Straub, 1994, p. 29). The machines were such a success that more than half of Japanese households had a fax machine in 2002 as a means to both communicate with friends and family, but also to place orders from shops or even to request information about e.g. weather conditions (Coopersmith & Kettl, 2015, pp. 153-154).

While the popularity for the fax machine has fallen, it is still in use. In 2020, 33.6% of Japanese households had a fax machine (MIC, 2020, p. 1). There are a few factors why the fax machine is still in use, especially in Japanese companies. These are a combination of an aging population and Japanese management. The Japanese population is aging at a rapid rate with roughly 35 million people being aged 65 or above out of a population of 126 million people in 2020 (MIC, 2021). Many of them have used fax machines throughout their working life as 81% of companies with more than five employees in 1994 in Japan had fax machines (Coopersmith & Kettl, 2015, p. 153). They thus know how to use them.

As they slowly started to move up in the hierarchy in their working life, they felt that moving to a new system (e.g. e-mail) would be more complicated compared to what they already know (i.e. fax machines) (Coopersmith & Kettl, 2015, p. 204) once they reached a position where they could make a change. The decision making process in Japan is a time-consuming process which requires almost unanimous support from people in the same position as well as approval from several managers, who will have used fax throughout their careers (Folcker, 2022, pp. 9-10, 13). Given that a younger generation soon will take these managerial positions, there is a possibility that fax will be phased out within the next few years or decades.

### Conclusion

Japan may have been an innovative country when it came to household electronics with their portable sound systems and video game consoles, but the last few years have seen very little innovation. In addition, Japan even uses some technology which has been phased out elsewhere. The fax machine became extremely popular because it was a solution for a problem which other technologies on other countries already had solved. These countries have now moved on to using e-mail, but Japan still relies heavily on the fax machine because of company management and because of an ageing population finding fax easier to use than e-mail. Certain technologies used in Japan may seem like it is living in 2050, but with fax machine usage, it is also closer to 1950.
