## CSS

CSS is used in the styling of the webpage. In a CSS file, the standard design features can be set for the entire \<body> section, but exceptions can be programmed in all \<h2> sections, for instance, if the design requires it. These variables of styling include text size, font, and colour as well as alignment. Backgrounds can be altered as well with different colours or images, and gradients can even be applied (Ajini, 2015, pp. 46-53; Larsen, 2013, pp. 130-133).

Proper website design is important. For this reason, borders (W3Schools, n.d.) were selected for the different headings to clearly mark a difference in the different sections. The fonts were chosen because there was a chance that Japanese text may be added in the future, and standard Times New Roman cannot display Japanese characters. The background colour was chosen because it is similar to paper used in books. This is to make reading a bit easier and to reduce eye strain while reading in a dark area. All in all, the design was chosen to make it a comfortable and familiar experience rather than a dark-mode style design with a dark background image with white or neon-coloured text.
