## API

An API is an interface which users can interact with for a variety of functions on a website or an app. Uber, for instance, has APIs for its many functions, including for its payment, geolocation, and review systems (AaronJack, 2021). In the simplest terms, the API connects what the user sees and chooses on a website (the frontend) to the program or script handing the process (backend). The API both receives the request from the frontend, and then delivers the result from the backend to the frontend. It can be compared to a restaurant where the customer is the user, the mmenu is the frontend, the kitchen is the backend, and the waiter is the API. The customer orders food from a menu (where the options have been decided by the kitchen). The waiter receives the order and delivers it to the kitchen that will then make it. The waiter then delivers the ordered food to the customer. Via this system, the customer does not need to interact with the kitchen to check specifics such as kitchen stock (Postman, n.d.). By that logic, if the customer were to try ordering off the menu, the API can still take the request, but the kitchen can decline the request, which the waiter then sends back to the customer. Alternatively the waiter can decline the request as well.

The API used on this website is one that finds a random image of a fox, which will be different every time the page is reloaded (xinitrc, n.d.). There are many other public APIs available online that can do a variety of functions such as display random images of other animals, do currency exchange, or embed a video or song from YouTube or Spotify just to name a few examples (APIs, 2025).
